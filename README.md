This is a simulation code for the project **Autonomous Battle Car: C++ & Arduino Controlled**. 
This simulation, written in Python was done to help with the software design and maneuvering strategies before implementing the lessons in c++.

**Short Description**:
A turn-based AI battle game where cars fight with lasers and strategy.

  **Hide** – The AI attacks. You must dodge and stay hidden behind obstacles to survive the laser onslaught.

  **Attack** – Now the roles flip. The AI hides, and it’s your turn to strike. Line up your shot and take it down.

  **Your Choice** – Pick your role: attack or hide. Outsmart the AI your way.

Choose what mode you want to play, and have fun.
Make sure you have pygame installed.
